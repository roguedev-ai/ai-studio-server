# CM1 - Gideon Studio Continuity Management

## Mission
Build systematic continuity and roadmap planning for Gideon Studio evolution beyond Phase 1 MVP.

## 🎯 Phase Assessment & Planning Framework

### Completed: Phase 1 ✅
- **Deliverable**: Branded LobeChat fork with Discover disabled
- **Scope**: Core AI chat functionality with Gideon Studio identity
- **Status**: Production deployable, tested foundation

### Current: Phase 2 (RAG & Knowledge)
- **Deliverable**: Document processing with vector search and RAG
- **Scope**: Extend chat capabilities with private knowledge base
- **Timeline**: 4-6 weeks development

### Planned: Phase 3-5 Future Roadmap
- **Deliverable**: MCP integration + Personalization + Production hardening

## 🔬 Infrastructure Analysis Complete ✅

**Key Findings:**
- **file-loaders package**: Native support for PDF, Word, Excel, images
- **context-engine package**: Context pipeline processing framework
- **Modular architecture**: Supports chromadb/vector database integration
- **Plugin system**: Extensible for custom RAG implementations

## 🚀 Development Continuity Goals

1. **Systematic planning** before implementation
2. **Technical debt prevention** through proper analysis
3. **Scalability planning** for future phases
4. **Maintenance readiness** built into foundation
5. **Risk mitigation** through comprehensive testing

## 📊 Next Actions

**Immediate (Analysis Phase):**
- [ ] Document Phase 2 technical implementation details
- [ ] Create ChromaDB integration architecture specification
- [ ] Inventory existing UI components for reuse
- [ ] Define testing and validation framework

**Planning Phase:**
- [ ] Create detailed implementation roadmap for Phase 2
- [ ] Define success metrics and KPIs
- [ ] Plan infrastructure requirements and costs
- [ ] Establish development timeline and milestones

**Execution Phase:**
- [ ] Implement ChromaDB service integration
- [ ] Build document processing pipeline
- [ ] Enhance chat interface with knowledge base
- [ ] Test and validate RAG improvements
